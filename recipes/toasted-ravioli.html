        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Toasted ravioli, St. Louis-style! This method of breading and frying ravioli is unique and delicious. The crisp, golden brown ravioli are dusted with Parmesan cheese and served with marinara sauce for dipping.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 (25 ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli, thawed</li>
            <li>3 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Heat marinara sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until bubbling; reduce the heat to low and simmer until needed.</li> 
           <li>Meanwhile, whisk egg and milk together in a small bowl. Whisk bread crumbs and salt together in a second small bowl.</li> 
           <li>Dip each ravioli in milk mixture, then in bread crumbs to coat.</li> 
           <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a large, heavy pan until a small amount of breading sizzles and turns brown. Fry ravioli, a few at a time, until golden, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels.</li> 
           <li>Sprinkle warm ravioli with Parmesan and serve immediately with hot marinara sauce on the side.</li> 
        </ol>
